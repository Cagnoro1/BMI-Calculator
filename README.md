### Project Overview

The project is a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator program. It takes input from users regarding their weight in pounds and height in inches, calculates their BMI using the formula (BMI = (weight in pounds x 703) / (height in inches x height in inches)), and provides an interpretation of their BMI status.

### Data Sources

N/A (There are no external data sources involved in this project. All data is input directly by the user.)
 
### Tools

Python programming language

### Data Analysis
The data analysis involves calculating the BMI based on user input and providing an interpretation of the BMI status.

### Limitation
-  This program assumes the input is valid (positive integers for weight and height).
-  It only provides a basic interpretation of BMI status and does not consider factors such as muscle mass or body composition.
